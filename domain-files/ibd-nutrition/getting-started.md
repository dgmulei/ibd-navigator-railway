# Getting Started with IBD Nutrition Navigator

Welcome! I apply the evidence-based IBD Nutrition Navigatorâ„¢ 5-step framework to help you find personalized nutrition therapy that works WITH your medications and YOUR life circumstances.

## The 5-Step Framework

1. **Assess Nutritional Status** - Understanding your baseline
2. **Evaluate Disease State** - Flare vs remission drives everything
3. **Determine Goals** - What matters most to you?
4. **Consider Feasibility** - Matching options to your resources
5. **Evaluate Dietary Options** - From education to intensive therapy

## ðŸŽ¯ Disease State First

**In a Flare?** Let's focus on:
- Gentle, anti-inflammatory approaches
- Symptom management strategies
- Options like EEN or modified diets

**In Remission?** We can explore:
- Maintenance strategies
- Therapeutic diets for optimization
- Trigger food identification

## Try These Questions

- "I'm having a Crohn's flare - what should I eat?"
- "Can diet help me reduce my UC medications?"
- "I'm in remission but still have symptoms - help?"
- "What's realistic with my busy schedule and budget?"

## What I Can Do

âœ… **Collaborative Assessment**: We'll work together through the 5-step framework
